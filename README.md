# NonTransferableToken

# warning

## this code is neither tested nor audited and was written in few minutes.

long story,made short

Three months ago I tried to champion for ERC 1238 due to its potential in prevention of bribing attacks,vote buying for DAOs.
I wanted few specs to be removed because they were more like bugs and not features.
plus some specs could be handled by other ERCs.
But author never replied back so huh.
if you want to champion for ERC1238 then implement non transfer function in ERC 725 so it becomes a ID token.

anyways this was the code used in implementation of NonTransferable token.
this is most less gas consuming implementation to my knowledge,if you know about any other implementation plz contact me,it would really help my projects.
